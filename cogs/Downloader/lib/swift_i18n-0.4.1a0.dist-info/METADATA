# swift_i18n

Simple yet intelligent translator based on ICU message formatting.

This project is currently in an alpha state, and as such the public API may change in breaking ways at any time (but likely won't).

## Setup

This project requires at least Python 3.7 to function.

Until I can be bothered enough to publish this package on PyPI (likely after I come up with a better name for this project),
you'll have to install this from a release tarball like so:

```sh
$ pip install https://gitlab.com/odinair/swift_i18n/-/archive/v0.4.0/swift_i18n-v0.4.0.tar.gz
```

A simple example usage of this project is included in [examples/example.py](https://gitlab.com/odinair/swift_i18n/blob/master/examples/example.py).
