util_cog:
  cog: |
    Internal swift_libs utility cog

    This cog isn't very useful on its own.

  swiftlibs:
    _root: |
      Internal Swift-Cogs shared library command group

      Most commands in this group are only usable if your bot is started with the `--dev` and/or `--debug` flags

      You'll likely only find this command group useful if you've been specifically instructed to use something here.
    dump: Dump modules from the bot's module cache
    reload: |
      Reload swift_libs and all dependent cogs

      You can pass `false` to the `reload_prompt` argument to skip the cog reload confirmation prompt.

  reload_confirm: |
    Done. The following cogs must be reloaded for this to take effect: {cogs}

    If you'd like me to reload these cogs for you, react to this message with \N{WHITE HEAVY CHECK MARK}.
  reload_manual: "The following cogs must be reloaded for this to take effect: {cogs}"
  dumped: Dumped {count} modules from the bot's cache.
