As such, this cog doesn't load all available commands by default, but must instead be specifically loaded with `[p]misctools`.\n\nThis cog features the following utilities:\n\u2022 Cog debugging related utilities\n\u2022 Message retrieval\n\u2022 Permission breakdowns\n\u2022 Semi-accurate ping timings\n\u2022 General bot statistics\n\u2022 XKCD comic retrieval\n\n.. and much more; refer to `[p]misctools list` for the full list of available toolsets.",
