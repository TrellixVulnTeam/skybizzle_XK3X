  Muted users will not be able to send messages, add new reactions to messages \
  (they can still use existing reactions), or speak in voice channels.

  Examples for duration: `1h30m`, `3d`, `1mo`. \
  Longer form values (such as '2 hours') are also accepted, but must be wrapped \
  in double quotes if they contain spaces.

  Abbreviations: `s` for seconds, `m` for minutes, `h` for hours, `d` for days, \
  `w` for weeks, `mo` for months, `y` for years.

  `m` assumes minutes instead of months.

  One month is counted as 30 days, and one year is counted as 365 days. \
  Minimum duration for a mute is 2 minutes.

  Expired mutes are checked alongside expired timed roles assigned with `[p]timedrole`.'''
